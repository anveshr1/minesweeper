The project portion of the interview is to build a game of Minesweeper in Django/React.
There are purposefully very few requirements, to allow you to be as creative as desired: there are no hidden requirements that we're looking out for and not mentioning.
The game map should not be stored on the client side, to prevent the player from cheating.
When clicking on a box, an AJAX request should be sent to the server to determine the current status of the field and update it accordingly.
Game states should be stored on the server such that the player can get back to a game by going to the game's URL.
The most important thing to us is how you structure your code. While having a feature-rich product is important, it's more important to have something bug-free, with well-structured and easily readable code. A nice-looking and intuitive UI is always viewed favorably too.
Feel free to add as many bells and whistles as you'd like! For example, you can make it such that multiple people can play the same game together, or implement a leaderboard.
